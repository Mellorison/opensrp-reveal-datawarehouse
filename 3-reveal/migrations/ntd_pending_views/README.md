# NTD Pending SQL scripts

This directory contains all the pending scripts for the additional NTD reorting requirements. The materialized views are stoed within the `pending` schema. These views were created with the same structure as the previous NTD MDA report views.

The views are mostly empty as they are missing client and structure/location details as those pipelines are being worked on. There will be an update tomorrow (12/8/2020) to confirm that everything is working correctly.
